What is DataCloud!
------------

The main objective of the DataCloud project is to develop an ecosystem consisting of tools, methods and software components that can efficiently exploit heterogeneous
computing resources for managing Big Data pipelines on the Computing Continuum.

DataCloud suggests a Big Data pipeline lifecycle consisting of discovery, definition, simulation, adaptation, provisioning, and deployment stages, and provides not only the six interoperable tools to support such a lifecycle but also an integrated DataCloud Toolbox.

.. PUZZLE Platform
.. ------------
.. PUZZLE Platform has been developed to protect Kubernetes based clusters and applications deployed in them. It has two main parts, one local and one online. The "core" part of PUZZLE for privacy reasons can be installed in the local premises that need to be protected; this core part of the platform is accessible for the users via the PUZZLE Dashboard. The other part is the publicly accessible and centralized PUZZLE marketplace.

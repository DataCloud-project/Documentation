Welcome to the online documentation of DataCloud Project and DataCloud Toolbox!

What is DataCloud!
------------

The main objective of the DataCloud project is to develop an ecosystem consisting of tools, methods and software components that can efficiently exploit heterogeneous
computing resources for managing Big Data pipelines on the Computing Continuum.

DataCloud suggests a Big Data pipeline lifecycle consisting of discovery, definition, simulation, adaptation, provisioning, and deployment stages, and provides not only the six interoperable tools to support such a lifecycle but also an integrated DataCloud Toolbox.
